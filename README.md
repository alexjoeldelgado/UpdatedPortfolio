# UpdatedPortfolio
This website is a Portfolio website to show potential employers and recruiters of my accomplishments and skill level.

## Description
The splash page welcomes the user and introduces some fade in animations, along with animations triggered by 'mouseover'. This will link to the About Me Page, the Portfolio Page, and the Contact Page.

Below are a few screenshots of the website:
